# Lesson 4: Introduction to Object oriented programming

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Vocabulary

* class - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes

* object - an instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, a blue shirt, etc. However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.

* attribute - a descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.
method - an action that a class or object could take

* OOP - a commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming

* encapsulation - one of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

# Function vs Method

* A function and a method look very similar. They both use the def keyword. They also have inputs and return outputs. The difference is that a method is inside of a class whereas a function is outside of a class.

# Set and Get methods

* The last part of the video mentioned that accessing attributes in Python can be somewhat different than in other programming languages like Java and C++. This section goes into further detail.

* The shirt class has a method to change the price of the shirt: shirt_one.change_price(20). In Python, you can also change the values of an attribute with the following syntax:

```
shirt_one.price = 10
shirt_one.price = 20
shirt_one.color = 'red'
shirt_one.size = 'M'
shirt_one.style = 'long_sleeve'
This code accesses and changes the price, color, size and style attributes directly. Accessing attributes directly would be frowned upon in many other languages but not in Python. Instead, the general object-oriented programming convention is to use methods to access attributes or change attribute values. These methods are called set and get methods or setter and getter methods.

A get method is for obtaining an attribute value. A set method is for changing an attribute value. If you were writing a Shirt class, the code could look like this:

class Shirt:

    def __init__(self, shirt_color, shirt_size, shirt_style, shirt_price):
        self._price = shirt_price

    def get_price(self):
      return self._price

    def set_price(self, new_price):
      self._price = new_price
Instantiating and using an object might look like this:

shirt_one = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 15)
print(shirt_one.get_price())
shirt_one.set_price(10)

```

* In the class definition, the underscore in front of price is a somewhat controversial Python convention. In other languages like C++ or Java, price could be explicitly labeled as a private variable. This would prohibit an object from accessing the price attribute directly like shirt_one._price = 15. However, Python does not distinguish between private and public variables like other languages. Therefore, there is some controversy about using the underscore convention as well as get and set methods in Python. Why use get and set methods in Python when Python wasn't designed to use them?

* At the same time, you'll find that some Python programmers develop object-oriented programs using get and set methods anyway. Following the Python convention, the underscore in front of price is to let a programmer know that price should only be accessed with get and set methods rather than accessing price directly with shirt_one._price. However, a programmer could still access _price directly because there is nothing in the Python language to prevent the direct access.

* To reiterate, a programmer could technically still do something like shirt_one._price = 10, and the code would work. But accessing price directly, in this case, would not be following the intent of how the Shirt class was designed.

* One of the benefits of set and get methods is that, as previously mentioned in the course, you can hide the implementation from your user. Maybe originally a variable was coded as a list and later became a dictionary. With set and get methods, you could easily change how that variable gets accessed. Without set and get methods, you'd have to go to every place in the code that accessed the variable directly and change the code.

* A Note about Attributes

* There are some drawbacks to accessing attributes directly versus writing a method for accessing attributes.

* In terms of object-oriented programming, the rules in Python are a bit looser than in other programming languages. As previously mentioned, in some languages, like C++, you can explicitly state whether or not an object should be allowed to change or access an attribute's values directly. Python does not have this option.

* Why might it be better to change a value with a method instead of directly? Changing values via a method gives you more flexibility in the long-term. What if the units of measurement change, like the store was originally meant to work in US dollars and now has to handle Euros? Here's an example:

* Example Dollars versus Euros
If you've changed attribute values directly, you'll have to go through your code and find all the places where US dollars were used, like:

shirt_one.price = 10 # US dollars
and then manually change to Euros

shirt_one.price = 8 # Euros
If you had used a method, then you would only have to change the method to convert from dollars to Euros.


def change_price(self, new_price):
    self.price = new_price * 0.81 # convert dollars to Euros

shirt_one.change_price(10)
For the purposes of this introduction to object-oriented programming, you will not need to worry about updating attributes directly versus with a method; however, if you decide to further your studies of object-oriented programming, especially in another language such as C++ or Java, you'll have to take this into consideration.

Modularized Code
Thus far in the lesson, all of the code has been in Jupyter Notebooks. For example, in the previous exercise, a code cell loaded the Shirt class, which gave you access to the Shirt class throughout the rest of the notebook; however, if you were developing a software program, you would want to modularize this code.

You would put the Shirt class into its own Python script called, say, shirt.py. And then in another Python script, you would import the Shirt class with a line like: from shirt import Shirt.

For now, as you get used to OOP syntax, you'll be completing exercises in Jupyter notebooks. But midway through the lesson, you'll modularize object-oriented code into separate files.

# Commenting Object-Oriented Code

* Did you notice anything special about the answer key in the previous exercise? The Pants class and the SalesPerson class contained docstrings! A docstring is a type of comment that describes how a Python module, function, class or method works. Docstrings, therefore, are not unique to object-oriented programming. This section of the course is merely reminding you to use docstrings and to comment your code. It's not just going to help you understand and maintain your code. It will also make you a better job candidate.

* From this point on, please always comment your code. Use both in-line comments and document level comments as appropriate.

* Check out this link to read more about docstrings.

# Docstrings and Object-Oriented Code

* Below is an example of a class with docstrings and a few things to keep in mind:

* Make sure to indent your docstrings correctly or the code will not run. A docstring should be indented one indentation underneath the class or method being described.
You don't have to define 'self' in your method docstrings. It's understood that any method will have self as the first method input.
```
class Pants:
    """The Pants class represents an article of clothing sold in a store
    """

    def __init__(self, color, waist_size, length, price):
        """Method for initializing a Pants object

        Args: 
            color (str)
            waist_size (int)
            length (int)
            price (float)

        Attributes:
            color (str): color of a pants object

        """The change_price method changes the price attribute of a pants object

        self.price = new_price

    def discount(self, percentage):
        """The discount method outputs a discounted price of a pants object
